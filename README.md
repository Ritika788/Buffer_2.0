# Buffer_2.0
Buffer_2.0 repo to submit your projects to.Repository containing folder-wise code for all submissions to Buffer : A Project Series, conducted between April, 2021 - June, 2020.

Each folder should contain a separate README to describe the files and project objective

1. Main Objective of project was to implement Restaurant Management System using linear data Structures like array and linked list.

2. Data Structure used in project are array and singly linked list with implementing different ADT operation such create, Insert, delete, display. Along with that we provided to options to user such as Delivery and dine-in and a proper bill inclusive of all taxes was generated at the end was generated at end. This system works for multiple customers one after the other. Since Menu of a restaurant is fixed, we used arrays. Using arrays access and display of the items in the menu becomes easy. The number of items a user will order is not fixed. It is dynamically decided. So linked list was the obvious choice here. It stores items and prices, displays them and helps in bill generation.


3.To implement linear data structure such as Array and linked list very efficiently and it helped us to build a logic for project development using different data structures.

4. To build project using non-linear data structures.
